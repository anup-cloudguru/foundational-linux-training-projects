In this chapter, we will explore how to assign file and directory permissions using numerical values. This method is an alternative to the letter-based approach discussed earlier and provides a concise way to define permissions.

### Numerical Representation of Permissions

Each permission type is represented by a specific numerical value:

| Permission Type      | Numerical Value |
|----------------------|-----------------|
| No permission        | 0               |
| Execute              | 1               |
| Write                | 2               |
| Write + Execute      | 3               |
| Read                 | 4               |
| Read + Execute       | 5               |
| Read + Write         | 6               |
| Read + Write + Execute | 7             |

### Structure of Permissions

A file or directory’s permissions are divided into three groups:

1. **User (Owner)** - The first digit in the numeric mode.
2. **Group** - The second digit.
3. **Others (Everyone else)** - The third digit.

### Using `chmod` with Numeric Mode

To assign permissions using numerical values, use the `chmod` command followed by the numeric representation and the file or directory name.

#### Examples:

**Example 1: Assign `read`, `write`, and `execute` to the owner; `read` and `write` to the group; and `read` to others**

```bash
chmod 764 filename
```

- **7**: `read`, `write`, and `execute` for the owner.
- **6**: `read` and `write` for the group.
- **4**: `read` for others.

Run `ls -l filename` to verify the permissions. You should see:

```
-rwxrw-r-- filename
```

---

**Example 2: Remove all permissions**

```bash
chmod 000 filename
```

- No permissions for the owner, group, or others.

Run `ls -l filename` to verify the permissions:

```
---------- filename
```

---

**Example 3: Assign `read` and `write` to the owner, and no permissions to group and others**

```bash
chmod 600 filename
```

- **6**: `read` and `write` for the owner.
- **0**: No permissions for the group.
- **0**: No permissions for others.

Run `ls -l filename` to verify the permissions:

```
-rw------- filename
```

---

**Example 4: Assign `read` and `write` to the owner, and `read` to others**

```bash
chmod 604 filename
```

- **6**: `read` and `write` for the owner.
- **0**: No permissions for the group.
- **4**: `read` for others.

Run `ls -l filename` to verify the permissions:

```
-rw----r-- filename
```

---

**Example 5: Assign `execute` to everyone**

```bash
chmod 111 filename
```

- **1**: `execute` for the owner.
- **1**: `execute` for the group.
- **1**: `execute` for others.

Run `ls -l filename` to verify the permissions:

```
--x--x--x filename
```

---

**Example 6: Assign `read` and `execute` to the owner, group, and others**

```bash
chmod 555 filename
```

- **5**: `read` and `execute` for the owner.
- **5**: `read` and `execute` for the group.
- **5**: `read` and `execute` for others.

Run `ls -l filename` to verify the permissions:

```
-r-xr-xr-x filename
```

### Using Online Tools

If you find it challenging to remember the numerical values, you can use online `chmod` calculators. Simply search for “Linux chmod calculator”, select the desired permissions, and the tool will generate the numeric representation for you.

### Key Takeaways

- The numeric mode provides a concise way to assign permissions.
- The first digit represents the owner, the second digit represents the group, and the third digit represents others.
- Each permission type has a specific numerical value, which can be combined to assign multiple permissions.
- Use tools like `ls -l` to verify changes in permissions.

By understanding both the letter-based and numeric-based approaches, you can efficiently manage permissions on files and directories in Linux.
