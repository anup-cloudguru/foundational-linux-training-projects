  |---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
  | `chmod g-w file.txt`      | Remove write permission from the group               |
  | `chmod a-r file.txt`      | Remove read permission for all users                 |
  | `chmod ug+rw file.txt`    | Add read and write permissions for user and group    |
  | `chmod u+x script.sh`     | Add execute permission for the user to a script      |
  | `chmod a+x script.sh`     | Allow everyone to execute the file                   |
  | `chmod -R u+rw directory` | Recursively add read and write permissions for user  |

- **Permission Levels**:
  - **User (u)**: The owner of the file.
  - **Group (g)**: Users belonging to the same group as the file owner.
  - **Others (o)**: All other users.

- **Permission Types**:
  - **Read (r)**: View file contents.
  - **Write (w)**: Modify or delete a file.
  - **Execute (x)**: Run a file if it‚Äôs a script or program.

- **Viewing Permissions**:
  Use `ls -l` to view file permissions:

  -rw-r--r-- 1 user1 user1 1048576 Dec 17 10:00 example.txt
  ```

  **Legend**:
  - `-`: File type (e.g., `-` for file, `d` for directory).
  - `rw-`: Permissions for the user (read and write).
  - `r--`: Permissions for the group (read-only).
  - `r--`: Permissions for others (read-only).

| `*`      | Matches zero or more characters          | `ls ABC*`           | `ABC123.txt`, `ABC_Notes.txt`, `ABC.txt` |
| `?`      | Matches exactly one character            | `ls A?.txt`         | `A1.txt`, `AB.txt`                     |
| `{}`     | Matches any choice in a comma-separated list | `echo {A,B,C}123`  | `A123`, `B123`, `C123`                 |
| `[]`     | Matches a single character in the set    | `ls file[1-2]*`     | `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`               |

  sudo shutdown +10                 # Schedule shutdown 10 minute from now
  sudo shutdown 23:00               # Schedule shutdown at 11:00 PM
  sudo shutdown now                 # Shut down the system immediately
  sudo shutdown -c                  # Cancel a scheduled shutdown
