  chmod u+x script.sh                 # Add execute permission for the user to a script
  chmod a+x script.sh                 # Allow everyone to execute the file
  chmod -R u+rw directory             # Recursively add read and write permissions for user
  ```

  **Permission Levels**:  
  - **User (u)**: The owner of the file.  
  - **Group (g)**: Users belonging to the same group as the file owner.  
  - **Others (o)**: All other users.  

  **Permission Types**:  
  - **Read (r)**: View file contents.  
  - **Write (w)**: Modify or delete a file.  
  - **Execute (x)**: Run a file if it‚Äôs a script or program.  

  **Viewing Permissions**:  
  Use `ls -l` to view file permissions:  
  ```bash
  $ ls -l
  -rw-r--r-- 1 user1 user1 1048576 Dec 17 10:00 example.txt
  ```

## **üî¢ Numeric Mode for File Permissions**

In this mode, permissions are assigned using numbers rather than letters. Each permission type has a numerical value, and you combine them to define permissions for the owner, group, and others.

### **Numerical Representation of Permissions**

| **Permission Type**             | **Numerical Value** | **Symbol** |
|----------------------------------|---------------------|------------|
| **No permission**               | 0                   | ---        |
| **Execute**                     | 1                   | --x        |
| **Write**                       | 2                   | -w-        |
| **Write + Execute**             | 3                   | -wx        |
| **Read**                        | 4                   | r--        |
| **Read + Execute**              | 5                   | r-x        |
| **Read + Write**                | 6                   | rw-        |
| **Read + Write + Execute**      | 7                   | rwx        |

### **Using `chmod` with Numeric Mode**

- **Example 1**: Assign `read`, `write`, and `execute` to the owner; `read` and `write` to the group; and `read` to others:
  ```bash
  chmod 764 filename
  ```

- **Example 2**: Remove all permissions:
  ```bash
  chmod 000 filename
  ```

- **Example 3**: Assign `read` and `write` to the owner, and no permissions to group and others:
  ```bash
  chmod 600 filename
  ```

- **Example 4**: Assign `read` and `write` to the owner, and `read` to others:
  ```bash
  chmod 604 filename
  ```

- **Example 5**: Assign `execute` to everyone:
  ```bash
  chmod 111 filename
  ```

- **Example 6**: Assign `read` and `execute` to the owner, group, and others:
  ```bash
  chmod 555 filename
  ```

## **üõ†Ô∏è File Ownership Commands**

#### **1Ô∏è‚É£ `chown` (Change Owner)**

The **`chown`** command is used to change the owner and optionally the group of a file or directory.

**Syntax**:  
```bash
chown [OPTION] OWNER[:GROUP] FILE
```

- **OWNER**: The new owner of the file or directory.
- **GROUP**: (Optional) The new group for the file or directory.
- **FILE**: The file or directory whose ownership you want to change.

##### **Common Options**:
- **-R**: Recursively apply changes to all files and directories.
- **-v**: Verbose mode, which provides detailed output of the changes.

**Examples**:
- **Change the owner of a file**:
  ```bash
  chown user1 filename
  ```

- **Change both owner and group**:
  ```bash
  chown user1:group1 filename
  ```

- **Recursively change ownership**:
  ```bash
  chown -R user1:group1 /path/to/directory
  ```

---

#### **2Ô∏è‚É£ `chgrp` (Change Group)**

The **`chgrp`** command is used to change the group ownership of a file or directory.

**Syntax**:  
```bash
chgrp [OPTION] GROUP FILE
```

- **GROUP**: The new group for the file or directory.
- **FILE**: The file or directory whose group ownership you want to change.

##### **Common Options**:
- **-R**: Recursively apply changes to all files and directories.
- **-v**: Verbose mode, which provides detailed output of the changes.

**Examples**:
- **Change the group of a file**:
  ```bash
  chgrp group1 filename
  ```

- **Recursively change the group of files**:
  ```bash
  chgrp -R group1 /path/to/directory
  ```

## **‚è∞ Power Management**

- **`sudo shutdown`** ‚Äì Schedule or perform system shutdown.  
  ```bash
  sudo shutdown                      # Schedules shutdown 1 minute from now (default behavior)
  sudo shutdown +10                  # Schedules shutdown 10 minutes from now
  sudo shutdown 23:00                # Schedules shutdown at 11:00 PM
  sudo shutdown now                  # Shuts down the system immediately
  sudo shutdown -c                   # Cancels a scheduled shutdown
  ```

- **`sudo reboot`** ‚Äì Schedule or perform system reboot.  
  ```bash
  sudo reboot                         # Reboot immediately
  sudo shutdown -r +10                # Schedule a reboot in 10 minutes
  sudo shutdown -r 23:00              # Schedule a reboot at 11:00 PM
  ```
