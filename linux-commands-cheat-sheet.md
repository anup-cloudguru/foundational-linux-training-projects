# **üêß Linux Command Cheat Sheet**

---

## **Network Commands**

- **`ip a` (or `ip addr`)** ‚Äì Display all network interfaces and their IP addresses.  
  ```bash
  ip a                                # Shorthand for 'ip addr'
  ip addr                             # Full command, provides the same output
  ```
  **Note**: `ip a` is a shorthand for `ip addr`. Both commands are identical in functionality and can be used interchangeably. The choice depends on your typing preference.

- **`ifconfig`** ‚Äì (Deprecated but still works) Display network interfaces and their IP addresses.
  ```bash
  ifconfig                            # Show network interfaces and IP details
  ```

- **`hostname -I`** ‚Äì Show all IP addresses associated with the system.
  ```bash
  hostname -I                         # Display the IP address of the system
  ```

## **Accessing Linux via SSH**

- **`ssh`** ‚Äì Secure Shell to access remote systems.
  ```bash
  ssh user@hostname_or_ip             # Access a remote system via SSH (replace 'user' and 'hostname_or_ip')
  ssh -l username hostname_or_ip      # Specify the username explicitly with the `-l` option
  ```
  **Note**: The `-l` option explicitly specifies the username to log in with, which is especially useful when the username differs from your local machine's username.

## **User and Access Management**

- **`whoami`** ‚Äì Display the current logged-in username.
  ```bash
  whoami
  ```

- **`passwd`** ‚Äì Change user passwords.
  ```bash
  passwd                              # Change your own password
  sudo passwd username                # Change the password of another user (requires sudo)
  ```

- **`su`** ‚Äì Switch to another user account.
  ```bash
  su username                         # Switch to another user (replace 'username' with the desired user)
  su - username                       # Switch to another user and start a login shell
  ```

- **`exit`** ‚Äì Exit the current session or log out.
  ```bash
  exit                                # Exit the current user shell session
  ```

  cd or cd ~                          # Go to the home directory
  cd /                                # Go to the root directory
  ```

- **`ls`** ‚Äì List the contents of a directory.
  ```bash
  ls                                  # List files in the current directory

## **File and Directory Management**

- **`touch`** ‚Äì Create an empty file.
  ```bash
  touch file1.txt                     # Create a file named file1.txt

  ```

- **`cp`** ‚Äì Copy files and directories.
  ```bash
  cp file1.txt file2.txt              # Copy file1.txt to file2.txt
  cp -R dir1 /home/user/dir2          # Copy dir1 to dir2, including all subdirectories and files
  ```

- **`mv`** ‚Äì Move or rename files and directories.
  ```bash
  mv file1.txt /path/to/destination   # Move file1.txt to a new location
  mv old_dir new_dir                  # Rename directory
  ```

- **`rm`** ‚Äì Remove files or directories.
  ```bash
  rm file1.txt                        # Remove a file
  rm -r dir1                          # Remove a directory and its contents

## **Wildcard and Pattern Matching**

| Wildcard | What It Matches                         | Example             | Output                                   |
|----------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `*`      | Any number of characters (including none) | `ls ABC*`          | `ABC123.txt`, `ABC_Notes.txt`, `ABC.txt` |
| `?`      | Exactly one character                   | `ls A?.txt`        | `A1.txt`, `A2.txt`, `AB.txt`           |
| `{}`     | A sequence or set of choices            | `echo {A,B,C}123`  | `A123`, `B123`, `C123`                 |
| `[]`     | One character from a set or range       | `ls file[1-2]*`    | `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`               |
| `^`      | Start of a string (for `grep` and search) | `grep '^abc' names` | Lines starting with "abc"              |

## **Searching for Files and Directories**

### **`find`** ‚Äì Search for files and directories.

- **Search for a file in the current directory**
  ```bash
  find . -name "file1.txt"            # Search for file1.txt in the current directory (.)
  ```

- **Search for a directory in the current directory**
  ```bash
  find . -type d -name "DirectoryName"  # Search for a directory named "DirectoryName" in the current directory (.)
  ```

- **Search for a file starting from the root directory**
  ```bash
  find / -name "file1.txt"            # Search for file1.txt in the entire file system starting from the root (/)
  ```

- **Search for a directory starting from the root directory**
  ```bash
  find / -type d -name "DirectoryName"  # Search for a directory named "DirectoryName" in the entire file system starting from the root (/)
  ```

### **`locate`** ‚Äì Quickly search for files and directories using an index.
  ```bash
  locate file1.txt                   # Search for file1.txt in the system's index
  locate -i "filename"               # Perform a case-insensitive search
  ```
  **Note**: The `locate` command uses a pre-built index for faster searches but might not find recently created files. Use `updatedb` to refresh the index.

### **`updatedb`** ‚Äì Update the index used by `locate`.
  ```bash
  sudo updatedb                      # Update the index for the `locate` command
  ```

### **Note on `find`, `locate`, and `updatedb`**:
- **`find`** is more versatile and searches the live filesystem but can be slower.
- **`locate`** is faster but relies on an index and might not include recent changes.
- **`updatedb`** is required to refresh the index used by `locate`.
