# Module 11: File System Navigation
## Chapter 11: Absolute and Relative Paths

### Introduction
In this chapter, we will explore how to navigate the file system using both **absolute** and **relative paths**. Understanding these paths is crucial for efficiently accessing directories and managing files within a Linux environment.

**What We Will Learn:**
- The difference between absolute and relative paths.
- How to use `cd` to navigate to directories using both path types.
- Commands for verifying the current directory and moving up the directory tree.

### 1. Understanding Absolute and Relative Paths

**Absolute Path**:
- An absolute path always starts with a slash `/`, indicating that the path begins at the root directory.
- Example: To navigate directly to the Samba folder within `/var/log/`, use:
  ```bash
  cd /var/log/samba
  ```

**Relative Path**:
- A relative path does not start with a slash and refers to a location relative to the current directory.
- Example: If you are currently in `/var`, to navigate to the `logs` directory, use:
  ```bash
  cd logs
  ```
  Since `logs` is a subdirectory of `/var`, you donâ€™t need to specify the root `/` again.

**Key Differences**:
- Absolute paths specify a complete path starting from the root.
- Relative paths specify locations based on your current position in the file system.

### Screenshot Example
Below is an example of navigating to directories using both absolute and relative paths:

### 2. Practical Demonstration

**Step-by-Step Commands**:

1. **Become the Root User**:
   ```bash
   su -
   ```
   Enter your password to switch to the root user.

2. **Navigate Using Absolute Path**:
   ```bash
   cd /var/log/samba
   ```
   - The current working directory is now `/var/log/samba`.
   - Verify with:
     ```bash
     pwd
     ```
     Output: `/var/log/samba`

3. **Navigate Using Relative Path**:
   - Starting from `/var`, move to `log`:
     ```bash
     cd log
     ```
   - Navigate to `samba` from `log`:
     ```bash
     cd samba
     ```

**Important Notes**:
- Use `pwd` to print the current directory path.
- Use `cd ..` to move up one directory level.

### 3. Tab Completion and Navigating Up

**Tab Completion**:
- Press `Tab` to auto-complete directory and file names. This helps reduce typing and avoids errors.

**Moving Up in the Directory Tree**:
- Use `cd ..` to move up one directory:
  ```bash
  cd ..
  ```
  This command takes you to the parent directory. For example, from `/var/log/samba` to `/var/log`.

**Key Points to Remember**:
- **Absolute paths** start with `/` and are used when you need to navigate from the root.
- **Relative paths** do not start with `/` and depend on your current directory.

## Conclusion

Understanding how to navigate the Linux file system with **absolute** and **relative paths** is essential for efficient directory management. This knowledge will help you move between directories quickly, use the command line effectively, and build a strong foundation for more advanced Linux operations.
