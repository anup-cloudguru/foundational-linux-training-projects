## **üîß Basic Network Commands**

- **`ip a`** (or **`ip addr`**) ‚Äì View your network interfaces and IP addresses.  
  These commands show details about your computer's network connections.
  ```bash
  ip a              # Displays network details (short form)
  ip addr           # Displays network details (full form)
  ```

- **`ifconfig`** ‚Äì (Old command, still works) View your network interfaces and IP addresses.  
  This command is being replaced by `ip` on modern systems.
  ```bash
  ifconfig          # Displays network details
  ```

- **`hostname -I`** ‚Äì Show all IP addresses of your system.  
  Use this to quickly see all network addresses assigned to your computer.
  ```bash
  hostname -I       # Displays system IP addresses
  ```

## **üîê Accessing Linux via SSH** üåê

- **`ssh`** ‚Äì Secure Shell to access remote systems.  
  Use this command to securely connect to another computer over a network. You‚Äôll need the remote system‚Äôs IP address or hostname.

  cd                                # Go to the home directory
  cd /                              # Go to the root directory
  ```

- **`ls`** ‚Äì List the contents of a directory.  
  View files and directories in your current location:

  ls                                # Basic list of files
  ls -l                             # Detailed listing
  ls -lt                            # Sort by modification time
  ls -ltr                           # Reverse order of modification time
  ```

  cat >> filename                   # Append content to an existing file
  ```

### **Editing Files Directly**
- **`nano`** ‚Äì Beginner-friendly text editor.

  passwd                            # Update your own password
  sudo passwd username              # Update another user's password
  ```

## **üìÇ Copying Directories**

- **`cp -R`** ‚Äì Copy directories and their contents.  
  Use the `-R` option to copy a directory along with all its files and subdirectories.
  ```bash
  cp -R source_directory destination_directory
  ```

### **Example**:  
To copy the `dir1` directory to `/home/user/dir2`:
```bash

## **üîç Finding Files and Directories**

### **Using the `find` Command**
- **Syntax**:
  ```bash
  find [path] [expression]
  ```
  - **`path`**: Directory to start the search (e.g., `.` for the current directory).
  - **`expression`**: Search criteria (e.g., `-name`).

- **Examples**:
  ```bash
  find . -name "filename"           # Search for a file by name
  find /path/to/search -type d -name "dirname"   # Search for a directory
  sudo find / -name "filename"      # Search from the root directory
  ```

### **Using the `locate` Command**
- **Syntax**:
  ```bash
  locate filename
  ```

- **Examples**:
  ```bash
  locate filename                   # Quickly search for a file
  sudo updatedb                     # Update the database for accurate results
  ```

### **Key Differences: `find` vs `locate`**
| Feature                | `find`                         | `locate`                   |
|------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Speed**              | Real-time, slower             | Faster (uses a database)   |
| **Customization**      | Highly flexible search criteria| Limited to filenames       |
| **Database Required**  | No                            | Yes                        |
| **Requires Update**    | No                            | Yes (with `updatedb`)      |
