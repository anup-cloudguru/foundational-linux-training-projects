# Linux Training Projects

This repository, **linux-training-projects**, is a comprehensive collection of projects and exercises inspired by the *"Complete Linux Training Course to Get Your Dream IT Job 2024"* by **Imran Afzal**. The purpose of this repository is to document my journey of learning and practical application of Linux fundamentals. Through this project, I aim to build a solid foundation in Linux, preparing for real-world scenarios and enhancing my skills.

## Key Objectives:
1. **Virtual Machine Setup**: Instructions for setting up and configuring virtual machines using VirtualBox for hands-on practice. This foundational step ensures a functional environment for learning and executing Linux commands and configurations.
2. **Download and Installation**: Step-by-step guidance on downloading and installing essential tools like VirtualBox and Linux ISOs.
3. **Linux Basics**: Exercises covering file systems, permissions, user management, basic commands, and system navigation.
4. **Practical Applications**: Code snippets and examples for executing basic Linux commands and creating scripts to automate tasks.

## Why This Repository?
This repository will serve as a practical resource, enabling others (and myself) to:
- Develop a deeper understanding of Linux as an operating system.
- Practice essential commands and configurations in a safe virtual environment.
- Build a hands-on foundation that will be crucial for further learning in cloud engineering and related fields.
